About Us

Overview (Founded in 2007)
Real Wisconsin Website Design came about as a natural extension of the
many requests received from non-profit groups as well as our many friends
who run small businesses located here in Wisconsin and a need for them 
to have an effective social media website at reasonable prices.

As a leading edge technologist our founder James Murphy has always
stayed ahead of current technology trends and therefore started 
building leading edge mobile and social media friendly websites
for our many small business friends and non-profit group associates.

As demand grew we felt the need to make it official.
We ARE a Veteran Owned Business & Lifetime Member DAV Green Bay Wisconsin.
